# Hey there!  👋 I'm Sundaram Subramanian (author of dot-net-insights)

**Solutions Architect** | Cloud & Microservices Specialist | Backend Development Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub!  I'm passionate about designing and building scalable, cloud-native solutions using modern architecture patterns and . NET technologies. Here you'll find insights, projects, and resources focused on enterprise-grade backend systems and distributed architectures.

## 🏗️ About Me

As a Solutions Architect, I specialize in: 

- **Designing & Architecting**:  Cloud-native applications, microservices ecosystems, and enterprise system architectures
- **Backend Development**: Building robust, high-performance APIs and backend services using .NET and C#
- **Cloud Solutions**: Azure cloud architecture, containerization, and cloud-native design patterns
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, containerization, and deployment strategies
- **Database Design**: Relational and NoSQL database architecture, optimization, and scalability strategies

I'm committed to bridging the gap between architectural vision and implementation, ensuring systems are not just well-designed but also maintainable, scalable, and performant.
